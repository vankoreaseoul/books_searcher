## Caching Strategy
To provide a smooth and efficient user experience, this project includes a custom caching system for images and PDF files:

- All caching is implemented using built-in Apple frameworks â€” no third-party libraries are used.
- Once an image or PDF is downloaded, itâ€™s stored in both memory and disk to avoid downloading it again.
- The disk cache has a maximum size limit. When the limit is exceeded, older files are automatically removed first (using a "least recently used" policy).
- To ensure up-to-date content, each cached file has an expiration time. If the file is too old, it will be downloaded again from the server.
- This system helps reduce unnecessary network traffic while still keeping content fresh when it changes on the server.
